=== A Plea For the Truth, and an Earnest Exhortation to Be Found Walking Therein.

[.salutation]
Reader,

I desire you would be serious and unbiassed in
the reading of what I here present to your view,
so you may reap benefit and advantage by it to your soul.
The noise and clamor against the Quakers has, of late years,
been carried on and promoted with great diligence by their adversaries; insomuch as few,
I think, who converse with the world, can be ignorant of it.
This gave me occasion to inquire into their principles;
and that I might not take things upon trust,
or believe the report of others concerning them, I was willing to see for myself,
to read and consult their own authors.
To this I applied myself with great seriousness,
desiring of the Lord in great humility and bowedness of soul,
that He would open my understanding in the great things of His law,
and that if the truth was amongst the Quakers, I might,
without consulting with flesh and blood, join myself to that people,
however slighted and despised I might be by the world for so doing.
It was peace with God I wanted; and in comparison of that,
I looked upon all other things as dross and dung.

I had been always brought up in the national way of worship,
and had been strict and punctual in the rites and
ceremonies of the church of England beyond many;
but yet I found all that would not do my business.
The Seed was oppressed within me,
and death reigned under all those forms and specious appearances of godliness.
It was an easy matter to talk, and to go the round of my devotions,
but I lacked strength and power to overcome my sins and corruptions.
There was a cry raised in my soul after righteousness and truth;
and this I found all my outward observations could not give me,
for the kingdom of God is within men, though I was seeking for it abroad,
and doting on shadows.
And thus was I diverted from the pursuit of the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Jesus.
I lived in darkness and ignorance of the true and saving knowledge of God,
notwithstanding my high pretensions.
But it has pleased God to rend the veil, to disperse the clouds,
and scatter the mists and fogs, in a good measure, blessed be His name.

Know, reader, that there is a people in this age, who have paid something for religion;
and they will not be put off with shams and pretenses,
nor decoyed by the wiles of the enemy.
They are not easily to be imposed upon,
in the great things that concern their everlasting peace.
They cannot bow to images,
nor satisfy themselves with the husks and formalities of religion,
but labor to come into the life of holiness and the real practice of virtue;
whom neither smiles nor frowns can prevail with to forsake the truth.
These the devil envies, and to render them odious, he paints them out in black colors.
To be sure, in his account, they are fools and madmen, fanatics I'll warrant you,
schismatics, heretics, a dangerous sort of people.
"`Sirs,`" they say, "`look to yourselves, and as you love your souls,
beware of the infection of Quakerism.`"
This is the common language, whenever a people do not please the devil;
but if a people be tame, and open to his insinuations, if they can rest in a form,
and dwell upon words and notions,
then he reigns in peace--his kingdom is quiet --and no hard names are needed.

Well, reader, what I said before, I repeat now--it concerns you to be serious,
and to weigh things with a clear and unprejudiced mind.
If you will serve God, you must take courage and break loose from the world.
If you will come to Christ, you shall find true riches,
and a fountain of inexpressible joy.
If you die with Christ, you shall live; if you suffer with Him in this vain,
transitory world, you shall reign with Him in glory for ever.
Look not at your own weakness, but look unto God, whose grace is sufficient for you;
His strength is magnified in our weakness.
Let not then the cross discourage you, but take it up,
and in meekness and patience bear it after Jesus,
who for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens.
Come now, strip yourself from the creation; wean your affections from the world;
strengthen your hand in God; cleave steadfastly unto Him; make Him your friend,
and then you need not care who is your enemy,
for all the rage of men and devils can never hurt you.
Hearken unto God; obey His voice; mind the teachings of His Holy Spirit;
give up yourself entirely to the guiding of it, for its ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all its paths are peace.
This is that Comforter which is given to lead us into all truth.
Blessed are all those that are taught and led by it;
these see their way--it is made plain, and shines more and more unto the perfect day.
Trust not to uncertainties; put not off your repentance;
delay not the time of returning to God.
How do you know you shall live an hour longer?
Are all your accounts fair and clear?
Are you ready to depart, if God should call you before tomorrow morning?

Reader, once more I say--it concerns you to be serious;
for the day of God hastens wherein all false coverings shall be torn off;
fear shall take hold of the hypocrites, as sorrow upon a woman in travail,
and they shall not escape.
A name and profession of Christianity without the life and power of it,
will then stand on very little footing; it will be a terrible day,
who shall be able to stand in it!
Certainly none of the hypocrites, and shufflers, and vain talkers,
and disputers of this world, and empty notionists, and time-servers, and men-pleasers.
No, these will be all swept away, as chaff before the wind.
"`For behold the day comes that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes,
and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall burn them up,
say the Lord of Hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch.`"--Mal. 4:1.

Therefore now is the accepted time, prize it; now is the day of salvation.
Know, reader, that by the grace of God, you art capable of great attainments!
True faith will remove mountains; by that you may escape the pollutions of the world,
and come clean out of Babylon and Egypt,
and all such things as would hinder you in your Christian race.
Why then should we trifle away our precious minutes?
Why should we die short of true happiness?
Let the time past be enough for us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,
serving diverse lusts and pleasures, and walking in the vanity of our minds.
God has borne long with us; His mercy and loving-kindness has been great;
let us provoke Him no longer,
but instantly return to Him and humble our souls before Him.
This is the labor and travail of my soul, God knows,
desiring that all men might be saved and come to
the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.
O that all would taste and see how gracious He is!
If they would but wait upon Him in silence, with their minds retired from the world,
and staid upon Him, they may come to see wonderful things in righteousness.
Indeed, the mysteries of God's kingdom will be opened and revealed to them,
yes things which were kept secret from the foundation of the world.
Such will find true peace and rest to their souls;
they will find strength administered according to their various needs,
and grace to help in time of need.
Yes, they will go from strength to strength and grow in grace daily, as the Apostle said,
Eph. 4:13; "`till we all come in the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.`"
That we may all come to know, witness and experience this in ourselves,
is the earnest supplication and prayer of your hearty well-wisher and sincere friend,
to serve you in the Truth.

=== On Divine Worship, Gospel Ministry, and the True Church.

[quote.scripture, , John 4:24]
____
"`God is a Spirit; and they that worship Him,
must worship Him in spirit and in truth.`"
____

Our Christian belief is,
that every man ought to wait upon God in their measure of His own good Spirit.
He is to follow its motions, observe its counsels,
and make it the great rule and guide of his life.
As men wait in this and are led and governed by this,
so (and not otherwise) are they accepted and approved in the sight of God.
For this, and this only, can work all acceptable works in us, and for us.
"`Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.`" Gal. 5:16.
"`For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.`" Rom. 8:14.
In the performance of all religious worship,
we say there is special need that men should wait upon God in the gift of His own Spirit,
to feel the moving and assistance of it; for this is the salt of the sacrifice,
and this gives savor and life to every duty, and makes known our needs to us,
and instructs us how to apply ourselves to God for suitable relief.
The apostle of the Gentiles is excellent in this: Rom. 8:26-27,
"`Likewise the Spirit also helps our weaknesses; and He that searches the hearts,
knows what is the mind of the Spirit,
because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.`"
God is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth; and we wait upon Him in silence,
that we may be enabled to perform this worship and service,
believing that His Spirit will help and teach us to pray,
better than all directories and common-prayer books.
Shall we for this be ridiculed?
And because we are tender of the righteous Seed
of light and life in ourselves and others,
observing what the apostle enjoins, not to quench the Spirit nor despise prophesying,
must we therefore be called fanatics and enthusiasts?

It is not men's running through their prayers by heart, or reading them out of a book,
or undertaking to pray or preach by the strength
of their own reason and natural faculties,
that finds acceptance with God.
None of these can be said to be that spiritual worship and
service which God calls for in the days of the Gospel,
now that He has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,
whereby we cry "`Abba Father.`"
Not now, I say, when He has poured forth His Spirit upon sons and daughters,
so that they can and must prophesy; not now,
when God has so clearly revealed Himself to the world,
and told us expressly by His Son that He is a Spirit,
and that the true worshippers shall worship Him in spirit and in truth,
and that He seeks such to worship Him.
These are Gospel days;
this is the last and most glorious dispensation that shall ever be in the world;
and now God calls for a more than ordinary strictness and purity of life.
"`The times of ignorance,`" it is said, "`God winked at;
but now He commands all men everywhere to repent;`" to leave off their dead forms,
their empty ceremonies and hypocritical will-worship,
a worship which they can go about in their own time,
beginning and finishing it when they please.
Here many are making a profession of religion and godliness outwardly,
going on in a round of bodily exercises, and pretended devotions,
from one year to another, and yet are destitute of the inward,
experiential knowledge of Jesus Christ.

But blessed be God forever,
that He has in this generation made bare His arm in a wonderful manner,
and brought a remnant near to Himself.
These have seen to the end of types and shadows, and are come to Christ,
the life and substance, and to the one spiritual baptism,
that purges the conscience from dead works, to serve the living God.
And they are come to the true supper,
and inward communion of the body and blood of Christ, where they feed daily at His table,
and eat of that bread that came down from heaven,
which nourishes the soul unto eternal life.
These are brought off from all the world's carnal and literal teachers,
and are come to the ministration of the Spirit, and the teachings of Christ Jesus,
who is their Prophet, Priest, and King, the only true Shepherd and Bishop of their souls.
These are come to a true silence, and a ceasing from all their own words;
they wait for the arising of that Divine Power and Life which shall
render their service accepted of God and useful and beneficial to men.
They preach and pray as the Spirit helps them.
They observe Christ's rule and precept, which is, to watch and pray; plainly showing,
that before men pray, they should watch; that is, retire in their minds,
and wait upon God, that they may "`serve Him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.`"
"`For (as the apostle says) our God is a consuming fire.`"

Those who rush hastily into His presence, without due preparation and watchfulness,
they offer "`the sacrifice of fools;`" they do not come up with acceptance
on God's altar.-- Isa. 55:7. It is said of Nadab and Abihu,
that "`they offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not.
And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them,
and they died before the Lord.`"--Lev. 10:1-2. Let the
ungodly and uncircumcised priests and people of the world,
who on all occasions are so full of their prayers and devotions, consider this:
they would, I am confident,
be ashamed to appear in that posture before some of their superiors,
wherein they many times appear before God.
But, as I said before, they who know God rightly,
have learned to wait upon Him in the silence of all flesh.
"`Without me,`" says Christ, "`you can do nothing.`"
Being sensible of this, they have learned to bow and humble themselves before God;
not daring to open their mouths, or speak a word,
but as God is pleased to make known to them the mysteries of His kingdom,
to prepare a sacrifice for Himself,
and to touch their lips with a live coal from the altar.
When the well springs up, then they can sing unto it.--Num. 21:17. When God opens,
none can shut; and when He shuts none can open.
These wait, as the apostles at Jerusalem, to receive power from on high;
when God bids them speak,
they must speak--they may neither add to that which is given them, nor diminish from it.
They must not quench the Spirit, nor despise prophesying.--1 Thess. 5:19-20.

This is our Christian belief, with respect to the worship of God,
and the solemn offices of religion, such as praying and preaching.
And by the places cited, it may appear to every impartial eye,
that these are no new lights or upstart notions, but agreeable to Holy Scripture,
and the practice of the primitive Christians; to whose blessed example,
holy and pious life, we desire in all things to conform ourselves.

The church of God is the pillar and ground of Truth.
It is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.
The church of God consists of living stones; they are built up a spiritual house,
a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
These are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,
who in life and conduct,
show forth the praises of Him who has called
them out of darkness into His marvelous light.
This is a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
but holy and without blemish.
This is the true church and true religion,
which we desire all people would seriously consider and diligently press after.
